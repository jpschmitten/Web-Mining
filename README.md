## About the paper
In this paper I set out to answer the question if it is possible to build a trading strategy around the stock trades made by members of the US House of Representatives. Generally, I do find evidence that politicians outperform the market. A long-only, equally weighted Politician Portfolio with the top four most bought stocks each month with monthly rebalancing generates more than 20% alpha annually. Please note the limitations in the paper.
